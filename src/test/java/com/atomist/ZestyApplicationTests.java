// I believe in you. You can do the thing!

// Life is its own reason for being. It is beautiful to have a sense of beauty.

// Our bodies and minds are capable of far more than our psyche will let us achieve.

// You are the delta in what you do, not the things you did in the past

// I believe in you. You can do the thing!

// No need to say 'I can do it.' You ARE doing it!

// You belong everywhere you are.

// No need to say 'I can do it.' You ARE doing it!

// It’s only a thought, and a thought can be changed.

// Life is psychologically difficult for everybody.

// You are the delta in what you do, not the things you did in the past

// Life is its own reason for being. It is beautiful to have a sense of beauty.
