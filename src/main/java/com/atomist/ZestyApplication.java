// Make new mistakes as fast as you can.

// You are the delta in what you do, not the things you did in the past

// Our bodies and minds are capable of far more than our psyche will let us achieve.

// Make new mistakes as fast as you can.

// I believe in you. You can do the thing!

// No need to say 'I can do it.' You ARE doing it!

// Make new mistakes as fast as you can.

// You belong everywhere you are.

// Our bodies and minds are capable of far more than our psyche will let us achieve.

// You're good enough, you're smart enough, and doggone it, people like you.
